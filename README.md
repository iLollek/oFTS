# oFTS
Open File Transfer Site (oFTS) lets you transfer files quickly through PHP.

---

# Setup
You need a Webserver (i.e. Apache) and it needs to be able to run PHP.

1: Configure `$PASSWORD` to something different than the default password, `"yourpassword"`
2: Configure the Folder where your Uploads drop in via `$UPLOAD_DIR`. The default Folder name is `"uploads"`

You can change the File Size Limit via `$MAX_FILE_SIZE` and the expiry/deletion time via  `$EXPIRY_TIME`
